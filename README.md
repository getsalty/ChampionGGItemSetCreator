# ChampionGG Item Set Creator

####Why was this created?
I got annoyed by the reddit posts giving away item sets but not releasing the source code for the script.  I went and created this nice little GUI application that does everything for me. I am releasing it (even though it is not fully finished as far as GUI goes) because it might help others.

####How To Use
1. When loaded, you should go to the options screen and pick which settings are right for you. 
2. Once settings are saved, click the "Get Data" button. Click it and it will retrieve the data from Champion.gg for all champions.
3. Once it is done loading, click the "Export Data" button. This will export all item sets to your league directory.
