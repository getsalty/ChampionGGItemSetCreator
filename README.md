####Why was this created?
I got annoyed by the reddit posts giving away item sets but not releasing the source code for the script.  I went and created this nice little GUI application that does everything for me. I am releasing it because it might help others.

####Requirements
* Windows 7 or later (I have not ported this to Mono yet)

####Features
* Custom item sets for each champion based on Champion.gg statistics
* Popular skill order is shown on the item sets (vision tab).
* GUI to view all item sets and skill orders. **Still being revised
* Delete all previous item sets created by this program.
* Exporting all champions' item sets to game.
* Exporting specific champion's item sets to game. **Not finished yet

####How To Install

* Binaries:
  1. Download zip (button on the right)
  2. Navigate to championGG_parser/bin/ 
  3. If you want a stable release, use the binaries in the release folder.  If you want the beta release, use the binaries in the debug.

* Compile: download everything and open the Visual Studio Solution file. Compile from there.

####How To Use
1. When loaded, you should go to the options screen (Application->Options) and pick which settings are right for you. 
2. Once settings are saved, click the "Update Data" button. This button will update all the current data and save it locally on your computer. It will only need to be pressed once per patch, or as often as you want the latest and greatest data.
3. Once it is done loading, click the "Export Data" button. This will export all item sets to your league directory.
